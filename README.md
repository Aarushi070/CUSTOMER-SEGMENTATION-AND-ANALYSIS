# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation in the retail sector. The goal of this project is to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. By leveraging algorithms like K-means and DBSCAN, we aim to group customers into meaningful segments and analyze the characteristics of each segment to drive targeted marketing strategies and improve business decision-making.

## Project Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains the retail dataset used for analysis. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use and distribute this data.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step analysis, including data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, clustering, and analysis. Modular code for easy reuse.
- **`results/`**: Stores output files including segmented data, visualizations, and reports.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies required to run the analysis.


### Prerequisites
To run the analysis, you need to have the following Python packages installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `dbscan`
- `jupyterlab`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

1. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Ensure the dataset is in a format compatible with the analysis scripts (e.g., CSV).

### Running the Analysis

1. **Data Exploration**: Open `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` to explore the dataset and understand the features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Open `notebooks/02_data_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Clustering**:
   - For K-means clustering, open `notebooks/03_kmeans_clustering.ipynb`.
   - For DBSCAN clustering, open `notebooks/04_dbscan_clustering.ipynb`.
4. **Analysis**: Examine the segments in `notebooks/05_segment_analysis.ipynb` and `notebooks/06_visualization.ipynb`.

### Key Files

- **`kmeans_clustering.py`**: Python script to perform K-means clustering.
- **`dbscan_clustering.py`**: Python script to perform DBSCAN clustering.
- **`analyze_segments.py`**: Script to analyze and visualize customer segments.
- **`generate_reports.py`**: Script to generate summary reports of the analysis.

## Results
The results folder contains visualizations, segmented data, and summary reports. You can review these files to gain insights into customer behavior and segment characteristics.
